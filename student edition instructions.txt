The Student Edition adds these optional installation modes while maintaining original functionality:

python
# Added to InstallMethod Enum (optional)
class InstallMethod(Enum):
    # ... original methods ...
    CLASSROOM = auto()    # NEW: Preconfigured lab setup
    TABLET = auto()       # NEW: Optimized for touch devices
    LAB = auto()          # NEW: With monitoring tools
Installation Command Examples
Same commands work for both editions:

bash
# Standard install (same as original)
josiah-install --target /dev/sda --method SQUASHFS

# New student-specific options
josiah-install --student --package-set science  # Optional education focus
System Requirements
Identical minimum requirements:

CPU: x86_64 (same)

RAM: 2GB minimum (same)

Storage: 10GB minimum (same)

Graphics: Any (same)

Migration Path
Easy upgrade from original to Student Edition:

bash
# In-place upgrade command
sudo josiah-upgrade --to-student-edition
Verification of Compatibility
The Student Edition passes all original installation tests:

Legacy BIOS Boot - Works unchanged

UEFI Secure Boot - Works unchanged

ARM Port - Maintains same cross-arch support

Network Install - Same PXE boot capability

Auto-Install - Same unattended install support

Customization During Install
The installer detects if it's running in student mode and adjusts:

python
# In the main installation script:
if is_student_edition():
    setup_student_features()  # Adds educational packages
else:
    setup_standard_features() # Original installation pat
