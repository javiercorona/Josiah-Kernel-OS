📌 Overview
The AI Orchestration Kernel is a Python-based Linux kernel management system designed for secure, automated, and production-grade deployments. It provides:

Hardware-aware boot configuration (UEFI/BIOS, TPM, secure mounting)

Dynamic driver installation (WiFi, GPU, firmware)

Reliable initramfs generation (critical for boot)

Balena Etcher compatibility (for flashing images)

Robust error recovery (fallback shell on failure)

Ideal for embedded systems, IoT devices, edge computing, and custom Linux distributions.

✨ Key Features
Feature	Description
✅ Hardware Detection	Auto-detects CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, USB, and boot mode (UEFI/BIOS).
🔒 Secure Boot	Supports TPM, encrypted partitions, and secure key generation.
🔄 Dynamic Partitioning	Detects EFI and ROOT partitions automatically.
📦 Driver Management	Pre-configured repositories for Intel, Broadcom, Realtek, and Mesa drivers.
🚀 Initramfs Generation	Ensures critical binaries (busybox, modprobe) are included for boot.
⚡ GRUB Bootloader Setup	Works for both UEFI and Legacy BIOS systems.
🛠️ Recovery Mode	Falls back to a busybox shell if boot fails.
⚙️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Linux-based system (tested on Debian/Ubuntu)

Python 3.8+

cryptography library (pip install cryptography)

Root access (for GRUB, mounting, hardware detection)

Quick Start
Clone the repository (if applicable):

bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ai-orchestration-kernel
Run the kernel orchestrator:

bash
sudo python3 linuxkernel9.txt  # (Replace with actual script name)
Follow on-screen instructions for hardware detection and boot setup.

🔧 Customization
1. Driver Repositories
Edit KernelConfig.driver_repos to add custom driver sources:

python
self.driver_repos = {
    'nvidia': 'https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx',
    # Add more as needed
}
2. Secure Boot & TPM
Enable/disable TPM in KernelConfig:

python
self.use_tpm = True  # Set False to disable
3. Boot Mode (UEFI/BIOS)
The system auto-detects boot mode, but you can manually override:

python
self.boot_mode = "uefi"  # or "bios"
🚨 Error Handling & Recovery
If boot fails:

The system drops into a BusyBox recovery shell.

Logs are printed (BOOT FAILED: <error>).

Check:

Partition mounting (/boot/efi, /mnt)

GRUB installation (grub-install)

Hardware compatibility (drivers, firmware)

📜 License
Open-source (specify license if applicable).
